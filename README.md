# Revenu Ad Library

A free, public library of 544 high-performing B2B SaaS ad examples and landing-page templates, organised by formula.

Live at **[library.revenuagency.io](https://library.revenuagency.io)**.

## What's inside

Four libraries, each broken down by category:

- **LinkedIn Ads** — Problem · Product · Conversion · Conversation Ads · Gated Content · Animations · The Playbook
- **Google Ads** — Brand · Non Brand · Competitor · The Playbook
- **Landing Pages** — Above the Fold · Blocks · Product Visuals
- **ChatGPT Ads** — Playbook · Setup

Every ad has its own shareable URL (e.g. `/linkedin-ads/problem-1`) and opens in an in-page lightbox with prev/next, swipe, drag, favorites, search, and shuffle. A `/saved` route shows the user's favorited ads.

**Access is fully open — no sign-in, no gate.** Favorites are stored in the visitor's browser via `localStorage` only; there is no server, no database, and no auth anywhere in this project. (Earlier iterations had a client-side password gate and a planned LinkedIn OAuth flow — both are gone. If you see docs or links referencing a `?password=` param or `/admin`, they're stale.)

## Setup

None. This is a pure static site — no env vars, no database, no serverless functions. `api/ads.json` and `api/library.md` are generated static files, not endpoints.

## Local preview

Double-click `index.html`. The site uses a conditional `<base href="/">` so it works both in the browser via `file://` and on the live server — no terminal or local server needed.

## Add an ad

1. Drop the source file into the right folder, e.g. `images/LinkedIn Ads/Problem/My New Ad.webp`.
2. Convert to WebP if it isn't already (the runtime expects `.webp`).
3. Open `ads.js` and add an entry following the existing pattern:
   ```js
   {
     image: "My New Ad.webp",
     title: "Branded Notes",
     formula: "",
     tag: "Problem",
     category: "problem",
     platform: "linkedin"
   }
   ```
   **Append new entries at the end of their category block.** Ad URLs (`/linkedin-ads/problem-12`) are derived from entry order within each `(platform, category)` group — reordering existing entries silently changes every shared deep link after the insertion point.
4. Run `node scripts/build-seo.js` to regenerate `sitemap.xml`, `api/ads.json`, the LLM-friendly files, and all pre-rendered HTML pages.
5. Commit and push — Vercel auto-deploys.

## Backfill formula labels

472 of the 544 ads currently have an empty `formula` field. `scripts/backfill-formulas.js` uses the Anthropic API (vision) to propose a formula label for every ad missing one:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
node scripts/backfill-formulas.js            # writes proposals to scripts/formulas-proposed.json
node scripts/backfill-formulas.js --apply    # reviews applied: patches ads.js from the proposals file
```

It runs in two steps on purpose — propose first, review `formulas-proposed.json`, then `--apply`. Re-running skips ads that already have a proposal. After applying, run `node scripts/build-seo.js` and commit.

## Full reference

For the deep dive — data model, URL routing, every feature, build pipeline, maintenance recipes, architectural decisions and rationale — see **[BUILD-NOTES.md](./BUILD-NOTES.md)**. Note: BUILD-NOTES sections describing the password gate are historical; the gate has been removed.

## Deploy

Push to GitHub → Vercel auto-builds → `library.revenuagency.io` updates within ~30 seconds. No build step at runtime; pre-rendered HTML and SEO files are generated locally via `node scripts/build-seo.js` before committing.
